//! Scheduled-task framework for atomic-core.
//!
//! This module defines a minimal scheduling primitive that any transport
//! (atomic-server, Tauri sidecar, etc.) can drive from its own runtime. The
//! registry lives here so task implementations ship with core, while the
//! ticking loop itself is owned by the caller.
//!
//! Tasks are responsible for their own enablement / due-ness checks, state
//! persistence, and event reporting — see [`ScheduledTask::run`].
